# Island Time

I am a California transplant living on Vancouver Island. As I computational
chemist, I use some of the most powerful computers in the world to probe matter
at the atomic scale. What follows mostly has nothing to do with that. These are
the fun python adventures that consume my free time, mixed in with some old college
projects for the sake of nostalgia and just a *little* bit of what I do now for
research. I hope they offer an entertaining look at what you can do with
an old laptop and a bit of code and perhaps inspire or guide you as you build
things of your own!
