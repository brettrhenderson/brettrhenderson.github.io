I am a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Victoria.
I currently research nanocomposite dielectric materials, which have highly tunable
and potentially very large relative permittivities, making them good candidates
for capacitive energy storage or gate dielectrics in solid state electronics.
<br>
Outside of chemistry, I am always trying to improve my coding and software development
skills. I primarily use python for school and my projects, but I have recently
been trying to learn a bit about wrb development and have been trying to learn
some more javascript. I find great joy in building useful tools and applications,
but I also love building something just because I think it looks cool! There is
definitely room for personal expression in code.
<br>
I am also a huge lover of sports and the outdoors. I began throwing the javelin
on my university team in 2015, and I still throw competitively to this day
--when I am not injured...But I don't think all exercise need be competitive. I
get out hiking and mountaineering whenever I can, and always enjoy the space
the mountains give for self-reflection and bonding with friends.
<br>
I am so glad to have found a home on Vancouver Island, for both the academic and
outdoor opportunities it offers. Here's to much more island time to come.
