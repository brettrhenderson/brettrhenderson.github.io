  I am a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Victoria.
  I currently research nanocomposite dielectric materials, which have highly tunable
  and potentially very large relative permittivities, making them good candidates
  for capacitive energy storage or gate dielectrics in solid state electronics.

  Outside of chemistry, I am always trying to improve my coding and software development
  skills. I primarily use python for school and my projects, but I have recently
  been trying to learn a bit about wrb development and have been trying to learn
  some more javascript. I find great joy in building useful tools and applications,
  but I also love building something just because I think it looks cool! There is
  definitely room for personal expression in code.

  I am also a huge lover of sports and the outdoors. I began throwing the javelin
  on my university team in 2015, and I still throw competitively to this day
  --when I am not injured...But I don't think all exercise need be competitive. I
  get out hiking and mountaineering whenever I can, and always enjoy the space
  the mountains give for self-reflection and bonding with friends.

  I am so glad to have found a home on Vancouver Island, for both the academic and
  outdoor opportunities it offers. Here's to much more island time to come.
